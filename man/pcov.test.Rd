\title{Perform projection covariance independence test}
\usage{
pcov.test(X, Y, estimation.method = "u", times = 199, n.threads = 4)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{A numeric matrix of dimension n x p, where each row is an i.i.d. observation of the first vector.}

\item{Y}{A numeric matrix of dimension n x q, where each row is an i.i.d. observation of the second vector.}

\item{estimation.method}{A character string, either "u" or "v". If "u", U-statistics are used, if "v", V-statistics are used.}

\item{times}{An integer specifying the number of permutations to perform. Default is 199.}

\item{n.threads}{An integer specifying the number of threads to use for parallel computation. Default is 4.}
}
\value{
A list with components:
\item{method}{The method name: \code{"Projection Covariance Permutation Test of Independence"}}
\item{stat.value}{The test statistic value (scaled by sample size).}
\item{p.value}{The p-value computed from the permutation distribution under the null hypothesis of independence.}
}
\description{
This function performs a projection covariance independence test between two random vectors.

\examples{
X <- matrix(rnorm(10 * 7, 1), 10, 7)
Y <- matrix(rnorm(10 * 6, 1), 10, 6)
pcov.test(X, Y, estimation.method = "v", times = 199, n.threads = 4)
